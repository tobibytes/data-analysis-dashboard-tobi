# üìù Week 4 Assignment: Data Analysis Component

## Goal
Build a React component that analyzes a dataset and displays key statistics.

---

## Requirements
1. **Create a new component:**
   - File: `src/components/DataAnalyzer.tsx`
   - Use sample data (array of numbers) to start.

2. **Calculate and display:**
   - Sum
   - Average
   - Minimum
   - Maximum
   - Count
   - Median
   - Range

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Filter out non-numeric values
   - Show an error if no valid numbers are found
   - Handle empty arrays gracefully

4. **User Interaction:**
   - Add a button to trigger analysis
   - Display results in a clear format (grid or list)

5. **Bonus Challenges (optional):**
   - Calculate standard deviation
   - Find numbers above/below average
   - Calculate percentiles
   - Allow user to choose from multiple datasets

## Example Datasets
```js
const temperatures = [72, 75, 68, 80, 77, 74, 69, 78, 76, 73];

const salesFigures = [1200, 1450, 980, 1680, 1250, 1520, 1100, 1400];
```
